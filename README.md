# Redesign - Before/After

## Task Approach
Given the large codebase (~3000 lines), I focused on the most visible components: navigation & header list.

## What I Improved
1. **Visual Design**: Removed unnescessary scroll bar in the middle, added animations to nav bar and removed some text
2. **Code Quality**: Moved most inline styles to seperate css file

## Time Breakdown
- Code check: 15 min
- Component extraction: 10 min
- Implementation: 30 min
- Upload & documentation: 5 min
